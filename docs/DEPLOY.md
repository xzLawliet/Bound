# Reproduce Bound on NEAR testnet

These are the actual commands used for **guardian.bound-aoyamari.testnet**, with replaceable placeholders. Use **your own account** for all `YOUR_NAME.testnet` mentions. All accounts and funds here are testnet.

## Build

Rust 1.88+, wasm32-unknown-unknown, and `npm install -g near-cli-rs@latest`.

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path contracts/agent-guardian/Cargo.toml
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain 1.88.0
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --manifest-path contracts/agent-guardian/Cargo.toml
```

## Accounts

```bash
near create-account YOUR_NAME.testnet --use-faucet --network-id testnet
near create-account guardian.YOUR_NAME.testnet --use-account YOUR_NAME.testnet --initial-balance 5 --network-id testnet
near create-account agent.YOUR_NAME.testnet --use-account YOUR_NAME.testnet --initial-balance 1 --network-id testnet
near create-account vendor.YOUR_NAME.testnet --use-account YOUR_NAME.testnet --initial-balance 0.1 --network-id testnet
```

## Deploy, initialize, whitelist

Use supported current `near-cli-rs` syntax (CLI changes flags between versions). Example:

```bash
near contract deploy guardian.YOUR_NAME.testnet use-file contracts/agent-guardian/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/agent_guardian.wasm \
  with-init-call new json-args '{"owner":"YOUR_NAME.testnet","max_per_tx":"250000000000000000000000","daily_limit":"500000000000000000000000"}' \
  prepaid-gas '100 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send

near contract call-function as-transaction guardian.YOUR_NAME.testnet add_to_whitelist \
  json-args '{"account_id":"vendor.YOUR_NAME.testnet"}' prepaid-gas '30 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' \
  sign-as YOUR_NAME.testnet network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send

near contract call-function as-read-only guardian.YOUR_NAME.testnet get_policy json-args '{}' network-config testnet now
```

## Agent access key

`near account add-key grant-function-call-access` might require a TTY (best used interactively). For a headless supported SDK path, generate a new `ed25519` key with `KeyPair.fromRandom` in `near-api-js` and store it in ignored local credentials. With the **full access bootstrap key still in the account**:

```js
await account.addFunctionCallAccessKey({ publicKey: generatedPublicKey, contractId: 'guardian.YOUR_NAME.testnet', methodNames: ['spend'] })
await account.deleteKey(bootstrapPublicKey)
console.log(await account.getAccessKeys())
```

Afterwards the agent account should have a single Function Call permission restricted to the guardian and `spend`; remove revoked bootstrap credential files as well. Do not add your real user's NEAR keys to the agent's account or send them in chat.

Set `OWNER_ACCOUNT_ID` and `OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY` locally to use owner admin calls. Add `owner-id` and an admin script before browser wallet signing; until then, CLI owner controls are the implemented admin path.

## Demo

```bash
cd scripts
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Modify guardian/agent/vendor IDs; put agent secret only in .env.local.
npm run demo
npm run demo -- --negative-only
# Owner must pause first before this single-request phase.
npm run demo -- --paused-check
```

The script confirms (executed and verified with near-api-js 7.4 on NEAR testnet, on the first bytecode):
- Allowed 0.1 NEAR transfer to whitelisted vendor;
- 0.3 NEAR rejected over-max;
- 0.1 NEAR to an unknown receiver rejected;
- `spent_today` correct before and after, not hardcoded;
- Native 1 yoctoNEAR transfer fails using the exact Function Call key.

Those positive payments filled the 2026-11-06 UTC day to 0.5 / 0.5 before the in-place upgrade. The current wasm has no new positive payment. `npm run demo` reads daily usage first and refuses when headroom is gone, so a full run on that day stops before another allowed spend. `--negative-only` and `--paused-check` do not require daily headroom. See `DEV.md` for the current code hash `FagUutviDcjAKZY6Crv8Aj7H3T41jkqBFhuH1kCGWf3m`.

Agent `--paused-check` expects owner already paused and will return success only on `reason=paused`. Restore owner unpause manually with CLI.

CLI pause/unpause:

```bash
near contract call-function as-transaction guardian.YOUR_NAME.testnet pause json-args '{}' \
  prepaid-gas '30 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' sign-as YOUR_NAME.testnet \
  network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
near contract call-function as-transaction guardian.YOUR_NAME.testnet unpause json-args '{}' \
  prepaid-gas '30 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' sign-as YOUR_NAME.testnet \
  network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send
```

## Storage & test notes

Unit tests cover both ways the contract moves NEAR:

- `spend` creates a transfer receipt for the exact yocto amount when the policy allows. A rejected `spend` (pause, zero, whitelist, per-tx cap, daily cap, spendable balance) leaves `spent_today` unchanged and creates no transfer.
- `withdraw` is owner-only, rejects zero, rejects amounts above the spendable balance, and still works while paused. The receipt pays the owner and does not consume the daily cap.
- Non-owners cannot `set_policy`, whitelist add/remove, `pause`, `unpause`, or `withdraw`.
- `deposit` is not owner-gated. It only accepts a non-zero attached deposit.
- Amounts are integer yoctoNEAR. Views report the current UTC bucket immediately; the stored bucket rolls on the next `spend` or `set_policy`.
- Spendable balance reserves `storage_usage * 10^19` yoctoNEAR. That constant is `env::storage_byte_cost()` from near-sdk 5.17.2.

This is not a comprehensive audit. There is no owner-key rotation in the MVP. A full-access key on the guardian account can still change code or transfer NEAR outside these methods. `spend` does not restrict the predecessor, so any account can pay a whitelisted receiver up to the caps. No off-chain or TEE claims are made.

## Bytecode provenance

### First wasm

The first `guardian.bound-aoyamari.testnet` `view_code` hash was base58 `6SS3z8n8jBE2Co4pLGF6c24tAaWbi145PEtdvbZcLTh`, SHA256 `0164a8f67c6087542cff3dfbb7404e95c07c971e05fb16adf245f386ec2046b0` (standard base58 of the raw digest, not base58check). The string `3882a4N4K5525P3Q7663C23U4A9BJ13375UDWB9C78H` does not encode that digest. That wasm is no longer the account code.

On that first wasm, and still after the upgrade below, a read-only `contract_source_metadata` call returns:

```json
{"version":"0.1.0","link":"https://github.com/aoyamari/Bound","standards":[{"standard":"nep330","version":"1.3.0"}],"build_info":null}
```

`link` in that JSON is the prior repository URL stored in the wasm. The current public source is https://github.com/xzLawliet/Bound. `Cargo.toml` `repository` is unchanged by this documentation update, so the deployed bytes still name the prior repository. `build_info` is null, so the wasm does not name a git commit. The embedded link matches `Cargo.toml` `repository` from `469b74b` through `31ab724`. Those commits, including the documented deploy commit `05859e9`, have the same `lib.rs`, `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and `rust-toolchain.toml`. Earlier commits embed a different link (prior repository `https://github.com/aoyamari/bound` at `ec52f6a`, `https://github.com/example/onchain-agent-guardian` at `21f5987`) and are not that first wasm.

Rust 1.88.0 (`6b00bc3880198600130e1cf62b8f8a93494488cc`, LLVM 20.1.5), command:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS='--remap-path-prefix=/usr/local/cargo=/home/box/.cargo' \
  cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --manifest-path contracts/agent-guardian/Cargo.toml
```

produced a 255,267-byte wasm whose SHA256 is `0164a8f67c6087542cff3dfbb7404e95c07c971e05fb16adf245f386ec2046b0`. The same command without that remap, with this machine's cargo home `/usr/local/cargo`, produced SHA256 `7c5d346b89f53d5f4023970520861f0f50e688d8a1e1817cbdcccb431fb67ab2`. The two files are the same length and differ only in 20 copies of that cargo-home prefix inside panic paths. No contract build workflow existed; `.github/workflows/pages.yml` at `cbca672` built the frontend only and was removed in `44de228`. Deploy transaction `GdqpWg8PvXefyA3Y4ShMo2d73fxFp5CaqovCs6MBWrmg` does not store a commit id.

This identifies the first deployed source as that identical contract tree, not one commit inside it. The compiler note above is only for that reproduction. It does not assign a compiler to any other local wasm, and it does not mean a later source change or a build with `NEP330_BUILD_INFO_*` set will match.

`scripts/contract-provenance.py` prints SHA256, base58, and the embedded NEP-330 JSON for a wasm. Its encoder self-test still uses the first digest above; that pair is not the current code hash. `.github/workflows/contract-provenance.yml` is an optional later build: it sets `NEP330_BUILD_INFO_SOURCE_CODE_SNAPSHOT` to `HEAD` and remaps paths to `/cargo-home` and `/workspace`, then uploads a wasm artifact. This upgrade did not use those variables (`build_info` is null) and this follow-up does not change the contract.

### Second wasm (current)

Upgrade deploy [`Cb6saE7z...`](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/Cb6saE7zu8kRQUYTqqhjgmNpzooTTLJsov7FEvy4HCwH) of contract source `9e585567f69163f1e9bbbc4d53e35e9a9901983c`. That commit is the contract-source ancestor of https://github.com/xzLawliet/Bound `main`. Documentation commits after it leave the contract at that source. One `DeployContract` action and no init call. Read-only `view_code` matches base58 `FagUutviDcjAKZY6Crv8Aj7H3T41jkqBFhuH1kCGWf3m`, SHA256 `d8a46cdd310339fb0c9654eacdc7879894e0663038a64039e684b1d72d733110`, 255,688 bytes. No compiler version is claimed here for that file. The same observations were first recorded on the prior repository in [pull request #2](https://github.com/aoyamari/Bound/pull/2).

State survived the upgrade. Read-only `get_policy`: owner `bound-aoyamari.testnet`, max 0.25 NEAR, daily 0.5 NEAR, not paused, whitelist only `vendor.bound-aoyamari.testnet`. On UTC day bucket `20763` (2026-11-06), `get_spent_today` is 0.5 NEAR, so this wasm has taken no new positive payment. `can_spend`: vendor 0.3 NEAR `over_max_per_tx`; `near-examples.testnet` 0.1 NEAR `not_whitelisted`; vendor 0.1 NEAR `over_daily_limit`. Receipt-level over-max and non-whitelist spends on this wasm are still pending because the demo script refuses when the day is full.

`view_access_key_list` for `agent.bound-aoyamari.testnet`: one key, `ed25519:7MMphMSA1J6R9w9kWL2RJmj3nvC8P3T32dDYy2TyExA3`, Function Call, receiver `guardian.bound-aoyamari.testnet`, method `spend` only. A direct transfer with that key was rejected `AccessKeyRequiresFullAccessActionError` and was not repeated here. Pause proof: [`7uUR1gfa...`](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/7uUR1gfap394ABxjmsieZgEQWXa31zMSCgkoi1MVnsF5), agent rejection [`DBoVGpNm...`](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/DBoVGpNmUkLBX4M7Xars3JtmUuw9gASv5RMkeG1H3EEe), unpause [`G7HnvG3f...`](https://explorer.testnet.near.org/transactions/G7HnvG3fezT7jeWuzAWaAWn2EVw4Yx3JFumntZ8TZaD4).

Optional read-only checks, with no key and no transaction:

```bash
curl -s https://rpc.testnet.near.org -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"bound-view-code","method":"query","params":{"request_type":"view_code","finality":"final","account_id":"guardian.bound-aoyamari.testnet"}}' \
  | jq -r '.result.hash'
curl -s https://rpc.testnet.near.org -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"bound-meta","method":"query","params":{"request_type":"call_function","finality":"final","account_id":"guardian.bound-aoyamari.testnet","method_name":"contract_source_metadata","args_base64":"e30="}}'
```

Agent key scope remains off-chain: `near account list-keys agent.bound-aoyamari.testnet network-config testnet now`.

### Frontend

React/Vite/TypeScript, public `get_policy`, `get_spent_today` and `can_spend` via `fetch`; no browser key. Owner wallet UI is not wired yet until specifically completed; not represented as live admin. The required Node version is >=22.22.2. For a supplied secret in NEAR account credential JSON, keep the key file outside the repo and pass `AGENT_KEY_FILE`.

## Dashboard publishing

GitHub Pages for https://github.com/xzLawliet/Bound serves https://xzlawliet.github.io/Bound/ from the `gh-pages` branch at `/`. `.github/workflows/contract-provenance.yml` builds and uploads a wasm artifact. Source stays on `main`. A new dashboard release uses this command:

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run publish
```

`publish` runs tests, builds, then uses a dev-only `gh-pages` package to deploy `dist` to the `gh-pages` branch of https://github.com/xzLawliet/Bound. Pages deploys that branch from `/`. The live site is https://xzlawliet.github.io/Bound/. `frontend/vite.config.ts` has the `/Bound/` base. The published build serves `/Bound/assets/index-Z9pJAv1H.js` and `/Bound/assets/index-BlP7_agH.css`. Browser RPC is public GET-style contract view through JSON-RPC. Direct contract mutation is CLI-only in MVP; the web app has no wallet or credentials.
